## ðŸ§¾ How to Run

1. Install and launch PostgreSQL (or any SQL IDE like pgAdmin, DBeaver, etc.).

## ðŸ“ˆ Output Notes

All queries are accompanied by analysis, row count, and what the query reveals. This helps in understanding the purpose and expected result of each statement.

## âœ… Project Status

> *Completed* â€“ All 15 analytical questions and 6 manipulation tasks have been implemented and tested.
